# stl-to-svg

A tool to render 3D models (in STL format) as 2D vector drawings that can be exported as SVGs. This is useful for creating plotter drawings of 3D models.

The underlying 3D engine is Michael Fogleman's [ln renderer](https://github.com/fogleman/ln), ported to JavaScript by Brandon Dail: [ln.js](https://github.com/aweary/ln.js).

To parse STL files I use [stl-parser](https://github.com/amandaghassaei/stl-parser) by Amanda Ghassaei.
